## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Purpose

```{r load packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

# Import Data

```{r import data}
# Define path on SharePoint site for data
sharepoint_path <- normalizePath(
  file.path(
    Sys.getenv("USERPROFILE"),
    "California Department of Water Resources/Office of Water Quality and Estuarine Ecology - North Delta Flow Action/WQ_Subteam/Processed_Data/Continuous"
  )
)

# Import I80 data
i80_orig <- 
  read_csv(
    file = paste0(sharepoint_path, "/RTM_OUTPUT_I80_formatted.csv"),
    col_types = paste0("T", str_c(rep("d", 12), collapse = ""), "c")
  )
```

Now, the data looks as we expect it to:
```{r glimpse data}
glimpse(i80_orig)
```

# Create Plots

## One parameter

To start, let's make a simple line plot of one of the parameters collected at the I-80 station. We'll use the `ggplot` function from the ggplot2 package.
```{r plot one param, warning = FALSE}
p <- i80_orig %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = DateTime, y = Turbidity)) +
  geom_line()

print(p)
```

Hmm, it looks like there is some empty space on the left side of the plot without data. We can change the x-axis limits for the plot.
```{r plot one param change x axis lim, warning = FALSE}
p + scale_x_datetime(limits = c(as_datetime("2019-07-01 00:00:00"), NA))
```


## Multiple parameters

This is nice, but we can also plot multiple parameters at once on a single plot with `facet_grid`. But, first we have to remove the Quality Code variables and restructure the data to a long format using `pivot_longer`.
```{r pivot data longer}
i80_long <- i80_orig %>% 
  select(!ends_with("_Qual")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = WaterTemp:Chla,
    names_to = "parameter",
    values_to = "value"
  ) 
```

Now the data is structured so that the parameter names are in the `parameter` variable and the data values are in the `value` variable. 
```{r display data in long format}
head(i80_long)
```

Let's create a plot with facets. Use the `scales` argument set to `"free_y"` in `facet_grid` to adjust y-axis limits to the data of each parameter.
```{r plot with facets, warning = FALSE}
p2 <- i80_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DateTime, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(
    rows = vars(parameter),
    scales = "free_y"
  )

p2
```

This is nice, but it would be even nicer to make the plot larger so we can see it better. This is done with the `fig.width` and `fig.height` options in the top of the code chunk.
```{r plot with facets larger, fig.width = 8.5, fig.height = 11}
p2
```

If you would like to zoom in on one particular time period, we can use the `scale_x_datetime` function as we did above.
```{r plot with facets change x axis lim, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 8}
p2 + scale_x_datetime(
  limits = c(
    as_datetime("2019-07-01 00:00:00"), 
    as_datetime("2020-01-01 00:00:00")
  )
)
```
