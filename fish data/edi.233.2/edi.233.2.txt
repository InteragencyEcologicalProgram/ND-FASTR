  Largely supported by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP),
  California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has operated a
  fisheries monitoring program in the Yolo Bypass, a seasonal floodplain
  and tidal slough, since 1998. The objectives of the Yolo Bypass Fish
  Monitoring Program (YBFMP) are to: (1) collect baseline data on lower
  trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and aquatic insects),
  juvenile fish and adult fish, hydrology, and water quality parameters;
  2) investigation of the temporal and seasonal patterns in
  chlorophyll-a concentrations, including whether high concentrations
  are exported from the Bypass during agricultural and natural flow
  events and the possibility of manipulating bypass flows to benefit
  listed species like Delta Smelt (Hypomesus
  transpacificus) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
  tshawytscha). The YBFMP operates a rotary screw trap and
  fyke trap, and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys
  in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the
  bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding
  environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and
  enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data
  for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of our
  monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as
  identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high
  restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US
  Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter
  and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP
  informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in
  these plans, and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the
  bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary.
  Only juvenile and adult fish catch with associated water quality are
  presented in this dataset.

  Detailed methodolgy for the Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program is as
  follows.

          
            (1.) Data collection methods:

          
  SCREW TRAP: A single rotary screw trap is deployed at levee mile 14.5
  near the base of the Yolo Bypass Toe Drain and is typically operated
  from January 1st through June. If the first flush of the system occurs
  earlier, the screw trap will be deployed in December to capture
  out-migrating fishes. The trap site has been selected based on the
  following criteria for installation, operation, and maintenance: (1)
  suitable depth: greater than six feet at minimum flow and low tide;
  (2) suitable velocity: greater than two feet per second (fps) at
  minimum flow on an ebb tide (though during extremely low flow
  conditions, the trap may only make a handful of revolutions in a
  24-hour period); (3) suitable anchoring points; and, (4) limited
  public access. Once installed, the trap is reached by truck via the
  Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel/East Yolo Bypass levee. The trap is
  accessed daily using a small boat with an outboard motor during high
  flow or paddles during lower flow periods. During high flows and
  periods of high debris, the trap may be set intermittently through-out
  the day, or not set if the high flow becomes a safety concern. The
  screw trap operates using downstream flow as water strikes the angled
  baffles on the inside of the trapping cone. This force causes the cone
  to rotate and fish enter the upstream end of the rotating trapping
  cone, becoming trapped inside the trapping cone, and then fish are
  carried rearward into the livebox. Upon checking or pulling the trap
  fish are then collected using dipnets and transferred to separate
  buckets. Once all fish have been removed from the livebox, fish are
  measured to fork length on a wetted measuring board, and then released
  back into the Toe Drain. Chinook salmon, Smelt species, and other
  native species are sampled first followed by non-native species. Each
  fish is identified and counted, and then fork length to the nearest
  millimeter will be measured for up to 20-50 each species.

          
  FYKE TRAP: The fyke trap is deployed in the Yolo Bypass Toe Drain just
  below Lisbon Weir at levee mile six and is typically operated from
  October through June. The trap site has been selected based on ease of
  installation, operation, and maintenance, including: (1) suitable
  depth: greater than ten feet at high tide during low flow; (2)
  suitable anchoring point; (3) suitable bank: absent of large woody
  debris; and (4) limited public access. Fyke trap sampling is operated
  in conjunction with our screw trap and beach seine sampling. The fyke
  trap is typically fished and checked daily during the months of
  October/November through June. There has been some variability in
  sampling frequency in the earlier sampling years, with the trap being
  fished up to seven days a week and checked every two to three days,
  but was generally not checked on weekends unless the Bypass floods
  (see additional information section). Since early 2010, the trap has
  been consistently fished during weekdays and has been checked daily.
  When the fyke trap is deployed and operational, fish enter the
  downstream opening of the trap (10 ft. diameter), pass through the
  first funnel (3 ft. diameter), and enter a central chamber, then move
  further through the second funnel (1 ft. 8 in. diameter), and become
  trapped inside the upstream (terminal) compartment. The fyke trap is
  installed with one warning float attached to the downstream end of the
  trap and one float rigged to the upstream anchoring (nose) cable, trap
  guide and anchor cables are anchored to t-posts on the levee
  shoreline, and two guide ropes are also set to help guide the trap
  when it is rolled up the bank during the retrieval process. The fyke
  trap doesn't cover the entire channel as wings are not used, and
  should not be viewed as a traditional fyke net. The fish handling and
  sub-sampling protocol follows DFG (1997) to minimize impacts to salmon
  and splittal. The trap is rolled using a truck-operated winch to the
  edge of the Toe Drain channel in about 0.5 to 1.5 meters of water
  depending on the number of fish in the trap. The trap door is then
  opened and the fish are netted out using a long handled dip net. All
  fish are netted individually, transferred to a wetted measuring board,
  and then released back into the Toe Drain. Chinook salmon and
  splittail will be sorted from other species and processed first. Each
  fish is identified and counted, and then fork length to the nearest
  millimeter will be measured for up to 20-50 each species.

          
  BEACH SEINE: Currently, beach seine sites are sampled every-other week
  with a single haul from a 25 ft by 4 ft (8 x 1.2 meters) pole seine
  (1/8" sq. mesh). These are modified beach seine hauls; because
  the levee banks are generally steep, the seine is towed parallel to
  the shoreline as opposed to netting straight toward the shoreline. The
  seine sites include one perennial pond (YB), nine sites along the Toe
  Drain (AL# [above Lisbon Weir] and BL# [below Lisbon Weir]) and four
  high flow sites to capture floodplain inundation periods (CCS7, FW1,
  LIHF, and YB180; only sampled during floodplain inundation).
  Generally, during flood events, we begin sampling in the northern
  Bypass and then gradually work southward as the basin drains. Captured
  fish are identified to species, counted, and fork length is measured
  to the nearest millimeter for up to 20-50 individuals of each species,
  except for native species of special concern, where all fish are
  counted and processed.

          
  FISH HANDLING OF SPECIES OF SPECIAL CONCERN: The handling and
  sub-sampling protocol for special species caught in the rotary screw
  trap and beach seines follows California Department of Fish and
  Wildlife (CDFW) (1997) to minimize impacts to salmon, particularly
  endangered winter-run Chinook. Juvenile Chinook salmon are visually
  sorted between winter-run and juveniles of other races based on the
  Delta Model of daily length-at-date criteria of salvage facility
  catches (USFWS 1994; modified from Fisher 1992). Any winter and
  spring-run sized salmon with a present adipose fin will be immediately
  transferred to a separate bucket and processed, recording length,
  sampling a fin-clip for later genetic identification, and released.
  Fall-run will a present adipose fin will be processed after
  winter-and-spring run. Any adipose fin-clipped salmon are euthanized
  in a kill dose of buffered tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222), bagged
  individually (whirl-pack bags) and marked with information on sampling
  location, date, gear type, fork length, and time. Fish are then kept
  on ice in a cooler until transferred to our West Sacramento, CA office
  to be weighed, have their coded wire tag (CWT) read, and frozen at
  -20C. During periods of Delta Smelt presence, all Delta Smelt are
  prioritized and carefully identified to differentiate between Delta
  and Wakasagi Smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis).
  Following the processing of special species (salmon and smelt) all
  other fish are identified and counted: fork length is measured to the
  nearest millimeter on a wetted measuring board for up to 20-50 of each
  species. Any juvenile fish that cannot be field identified are
  preserved on ice with respective labels for individual identification
  and examined at our West Sacramento, CA office. Captured salmonids are
  inspected for characters such as presence of yolk sac, parr marks,
  silvery appearance, and deciduous scales to determine life stage
  and/or degree of smolting. A simple life stage designation (P, X, or
  S) is determined for each fish measured: 1) clearly parr (P) = a
  darkly pigmented fish with characteristic dark, oval- to round-shaped
  parr marks on its sides, 2) between parr and smolt (X, for
  transitional) = the fish is not clearly parr, but is not yet clearly a
  smolt either, 3) clearly a smolt (S) = highly faded parr marks, or
  lacking them completely, bright silver or nearly white color, and
  deciduous scales.

          
  WATER QUALITY: In addition to fish catch, water quality parameters are
  recorded when a fish catch sample is collected. Tide stage, weather,
  and trap condition are observed and temperature (C), electrical
  conductivity (uS/cm), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), turbidity (NTU), pH,
  and Secchi depth (cm) are measured.

          
  Fish catch data and water quality is recorded using data sheets based
  on a modified version of "standard" Interagency Ecological
  Program (IEP) forms.

          
            (2.) Datasheet available upon request (email data
  contact):

          
            (3.) Instruments and equipment:

          
  SCREW TRAP: The screw trap cone is 8 feet in diameter and designed by
  EG Solutions (Corvallis, Oregon). The trap configuration is as
  follows: Length: 22.5 ft, Width: 12 ft, Weight: 1300 lbs, Cone: 8 ft
  diameter and 9 ft length with 2 ft on each end for shaft (total of 13
  ft), Livebox: 4 ft by 5 ft with a 25 ft3 volume, Pontoons: 22.5 ft
  length and 20 in. width, with 9 ft between pontoons. During operation
  the trap is attached to an overhead cable originally installed
  December 2003 (replaced in 2011 after damage during a flood) with two
  cables attached to each pontoon to align the trap in the center of the
  channel. The overhead cable is strung between two large trees, each
  with two guide cables connected to concrete T anchors. The trap has a
  rear anchor to maintain the traps position during low flow periods and
  strong flood tides. A revolution counter was installed on the main
  shaft of the screw trap in March 2013.

          
  FYKE TRAP: The fyke trap is 10 feet in diameter and 24 feet long with
  a modified design based on fyke traps operated by the California
  Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). It is constructed out of
  square stainless steel tubing with galvanized chain link fencing for
  the main structural netting and black 0.5" square polypropylene
  fencing lining the terminal compartment to aid in retention and fish
  safety. The fyke trap is operated with a 12,000 lb winch system
  attached to a truck.

          
  BEACH SEINE: Depending on the time period, a 50 ft by 4 ft beach seine
  or a 25 ft by 4 ft beach seine (starting October 2012 to current) was
  used to sample during all hydrologic phases, both with a 4 ft bag. The
  net opening area (avg. depth between two poles x distance between
  poles) is recorded for each seine. The volume sampled is then recorded
  as the measured length of set (e.g. distance walked with the seine,
  commonly 30 m) multiplied by the net opening area. During pilot years
  of the Yolo Bypass Monitoring program, alternate beach seines,
  including sizes up to 100 ft, were used, in addition to seine
  enclosures and cove sets (see project history for more information).

          
  WATER QUALITY: Water quality measures are taken with a YSI ProDSS
  handheld meter. YSIs are calibrated for pH, turbidity, DO, and EC
  bi-monthly, and calibrated for DO daily before using in the field.

          
            (4.) Analysis and methods (standard operating
  procedures): Data is in its original form and no catch per
  effort calculations have been made. SOPs for methods and quality
  checks are available upon request.

          
            (5.) Project history (change in methods and
  locations):

          
  All fish sampling (screw trap, fyke trap, and beach seines) must be
  adjusted under different velocity and flooding levels because of
  debris, permitting, and safety issues. However, the influence of flows
  and flooding is not straightforward because discharge, tidal
  inundation, and seasonal short-duration flooding impact the
  feasibility of sampling at any one site. Additionally, because
  sampling is meant to be repeatable, all sampling methods are
  proportionally sampling less when available habitat increases with
  over-bank flows. For example, it is likely that screw trap efficiency
  may be quite low during drought conditions because tidal velocities
  are correspondingly low, so the rotary screw trap only samples
  efficiently during a small portion of the day. Generally, during low
  flow, the screw trap only operates on an ebb tide. In wetter years,
  analyses of rotary screw trap data do not support the hypothesis that
  trap efficiency is a primary driver of Chinook salmon catch trends in
  Yolo Bypass (Sommer et al. 2005), however during flooding events the
  trap samples proportionally less of the available habitat. During
  periods of flooding/high flows (e.g. 2006 and 2011) in the Yolo
  bypass, the fyke trap is often times not fished due to heavy debris
  loads, equipment limitations, and staff safety. Additionally, during
  periods of high flows and receding floodplain stages, seining at AL#
  and BL# sites may become too deep to seine for extended periods of
  time until conditions stabilize. It should also be noted that during
  the first two years of the monitoring program (1998-1999) additional
  exploratory fishing methods were used including a Fyke Net (FNET),
  Purse seine (PSEIN), a 30 and 100 ft beach seines (SEINE30 and
  SEINE100), enclosed and cove seines (SEINENCL and SEINCOVE) and a 5 ft
  rotary screw trap (RSTR5). These data are provided in this dataset to
  provide insight into special species presence in the Yolo Bypass such
  as Chinook salmon and showing the importance of monitoring in the
  Bypass; however, these extra methods were not continued in the core
  monitoring program. Core monitoring includes the screw trap (RSTR, 8'
  cone), fyke trap (FKTR) and beach seines (SEINE50) and have been
  continued to the present (2018).

          
  Specific considerations for each fishing method/gear type are as
  follows and should be considered in analyses:

          
  SCREW TRAP: Rotary screw trap (RSTR8) operation began in 1998,
  deployment generally occurs from December/January through June, and
  that period of months has been sampled relatively consistently every
  year of the monitoring program. Throughout the history of the program
  there have sometimes been two rotary screw traps in place (1998 and
  1999), the screw trap has been installed one month early to capture
  winter flooding events (December 2012), and operational challenges
  have augmented its sampling frequency (see explanation below). When
  ESA listed fish are caught, some operational flexibility is required,
  for example shorter day-time only sets are fished when we near the
  lethal take limit for Delta Smelt, winter-run Chinook salmon, and
  Steelhead/Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
  High debris loads can also mandate shorter sets, which have been as
  short as one hour in some instances. Volume cannot be measured because
  there has not always been a flow-meter in place; effort is generally
  reported in trap operation hours. However, "set",
  "check" and "pull" dates and times were not always
  reported, and therefore operation hours must be calculated as an
  estimate using the fish capture events in some years. Best estimated
  hours for effort calculation are provided in a separate table. As of
  March 2013, catch per unit effort can be reported as catch per
  rotation with the revolution counter data.

          
  Screw trap effort alterations:

          
  1998: a 5 ft rotary screw trap (RTSR5) was used for one less than
  month in January and February during high flows after which the 8 ft
  screw trap (RSTR8) was used to current, 2018.

          
  2000-2009: the rotary screw trap was often set over weekends and
  checked every 1-2 days.

          
  2010: the operation of the trap was changed to daily checks and only
  set on weekends during some flooding events.

          
  2011: Damage due to high debris loads resulted in several weeks of no
  operation in late March and April.

          
  2012: High catches of ESA listed species resulted in shorter daytime
  only sets intermittently from January through March.

          
  2016: High catches of ESA listed species resulted in shorter daytime
  only sets intermittently for one month (March 29th through April
  26th).

          
  2017: Short day-time only sets intermittently from January to May due
  to high floods.

          
  FYKE TRAP: There have been several changes in sampling frequency, the
  number of traps and trap location throughout this monitoring effort:
  (1) in 1998 and 1999 there were two traps fishing four months a year
  and seven days a week, (2) in 2001 a second trap was deployed, (3) in
  2002 there was a design change in the fyke trap and three fyke traps
  were deployed, (4) between 2003 and 2006 the trap was check
  every-other day instead of daily, and (5) in 2014 and 2015 clogging by
  water hyacinth rendered the trap likely ineffective for some period
  and the trap was out of operation and then relocated (from October to
  December). See Additional Information for more data analyses
  considerations and alterations in trapping hours. Catch of certain
  species may be affected by fish already present in the trap. For
  example, white sturgeon catch increases dramatically when a female is
  present in the trap as multiple males attempt to gain access to her.
  Similarly, it is important to remember that predation can occur in the
  trap, especially on days where exceptionally large piscivorous fish
  are caught. The fyke trap doesn't cover the entire channel and wings
  are not used, and hence the fyke trap should not be viewed as a
  traditional fyke net. The data is most appropriate for presence and
  timing.

          
  Fyke trap effort alterations:

          
  1998: During the first year of the program and a high flow year, a
  Fyke net was deployed intermittently off the Yolo Bypass Causeway
  bridge from January to February. This method was removed from the
  program after 1998, after which only the Fyke trap was used,
  1999-2018.

          
  2000-2009: the high number of sampling hours were due to the fyke trap
  often being fished over weekends and checked every 1-2 days.

          
  2010: operation of the fyke trap changed to daily checks with no
  weekend fishing in 2010.

          
  2014: clogging by water hyacinth likely reduced trap efficiency for
  some period and the trap was out of operation and then temporarily
  relocated to a downstream location (Alt_Fyke). Trap was not operated
  October 10th to November 13th.

          
  2015: clogging by water hyacinth likely reduced trap efficiency for
  some period and the trap was out of operation and then temporarily
  relocated to a downstream location (Alt_Fyke). Trap not operated from
  December 1st to 10th.

          
  2016: trap was not operated in November for bank reconstruction.

          
  2017: trap was operated intermittently during high flood times.

          
  BEACH SEINE: Throughout the history of the program there have been
  three perennial pond sites: (1) Yolo Basin Wetlands "study
  pond", located next the tree grove at I-80 Causeway (YB), (2) a
  Fremont Weir wetlands pond, located approximately 1 mile south of the
  weir along the east levee (FW), and (3) Sacramento Bypass (scour pond
  and large earthen pond at south levee) (SB). Historically, depending
  on pond size, 1-3 three standard "U.S. Fish and
  Wildlife-style" (e.g. perpendicular) beach seine hauls would be
  performed at random coordinates around the perimeter of each pond
  site. In 1998, inundated floodplain sites were established at Fremont
  Weir (FW1), I-5 (CCS7), Yolo Causeway (YBI80), Lisbon Weir (LIHF or
  LI), and the screw trap site (BL4). In 2010, an additional four sites
  Above Lisbon Weir (AL 1-4) and five site Below Lisbon (BL 1-5) were
  added as year-round sampling to provide better spatial and temporal
  data on fish assemblages within the Yolo Bypass Toe Drain. All but the
  Yolo Causeway site (YB) are located along the east levee as this is
  the direction the bypass drains and remains wetted the longest. As
  many of these stations as possible are sampled weekly during
  floodplain inundation of the Bypass. However, sites such as the Yolo
  Causeway ramp cannot be sampled except at high flows (eg greater than
  30,000 cfs). Finally, BL6 was added in 2015 because water hyacinth
  obstructed much of the Toe Drain and made BL5 too difficult to seine
  properly. In early years, beach seining only occurred consistently in
  the winter-spring (Dec - Jun) at sites YB, BL4, and LI (i.e. those
  sites and months are the target of comparisons across the entire beach
  seine monitoring time series); however, since the inclusion of Above
  (AL 1-4) and Below Lisbon (BL 1-4) sites seining has been conducted
  bi-weekly, year-round, across sites when possible, and the high flow
  sites: FW1, CCS7, SB, LIHF, and YBI80 were also only sampled during
  flooding events.

          
  There are several sampling frequency changes to the beach seine
  sampling:

          
  1998-1999: additional seining efforts during a high flood year were
  conducted in addition to the 50 ft seine (SEINE50), such as SEIN30 (30
  ft), SEINE100 (100 ft), SEINCOVE (beach seine cove set), SEINENCL
  (beach seine enclosure), and PSEIN100 (100 ft purse seine).

          
  1998 to 2006: additional sampling was conducted during floodplain
  inundation and drainage events.

          
  2007: additional sites were sampled in the Cache Slough complex.

          
  2008: additional sampling was conducted during floodplain inundation
  and drainage events, not including sites in the Cache Slough complex.

          
  2010: fall, the additional above Lisbon Weir (AL 1-4) and below Lisbon
  (BL 1-5) were added as year-round sampling to provide better spatial
  and temporal data on fish assemblages within the Yolo Bypass Toe
  Drain.

          
  2011 to 2012: additional sampling was conducted during floodplain
  inundation and drainage events.

          
  2015: Site BL6 was added because of difficulty sampling BL5 in 2012,
  2013, and 2014 due to clogging from water hyacinth (e.g. complete site
  coverage).

          
  2018: AL-2 was removed based on analyses of AL sites showing
  homogenous fish catches across sites during both wet and dry years
  (report available upon request), and AL1 was moved 30 m upstream due
  to erosion during the 2017 flood.

          
            (6.) QA/QC:

          
  METHODS: All field staff have taken a fish identification course for
  California freshwater and anadromous fishes. Fish identification
  resources and dichotomous keys are carried with the field crew if
  needed, and the field lead always checks fish identification if in
  question. For special species including Osmerids (Delta Smelt,
  Wakasagi and Longfin Smelt) and Chinook salmon (Winter, Spring, and
  Fall/Late-Fall run) fin clips are sampled for genetic identifications
  and take reporting purposes.

          
  DATA: Date QA/QC is a four-stage process. First, the data sheets are
  error checked at the end of each sampling collection by the field
  lead. Data is then entered in a Microsoft Access form with customized
  error-checking and data validation checks. Third, a separate person
  compares the original field data sheets to the values in electronic
  database. Finally, each data field is sorted and/or summarized based
  on unique records to highlight erroneous outliers. In addition to data
  sorting, qualitative analyses are conducted on the water quality data
  by creating multi-layered visualizations of data in R-studio
  including; boxplots, histograms, and regressions of correlated water
  quality parameters from sampling sites across time, as well as
  overlaying a real-time monitoring data from a sonde deployed at
  Lisbon, a centrally located station between the traps, and beach seine
  sites for a final check for inaccurate data entry errors.

          
            (7.) Contractor information: All fish
  identification and water quality measures are conducted by the field
  staff in the Aquatic Ecology Section, Division of Environmental
  Services, California Department of Water Resources. Genetic
  identification of Osmerids and Chinook salmon run-type is conducted by
  the Genomic Variation Laboratory at the University of California
  Davis.

          
            (8.) External review process: There is no
  external review process.
